### Preview
To provide a comprehensive understanding of the submission, add visuals such as GIFs, images and videos have been incorporated to give an impression of what it looks like.



### Prerequisites

The backend uses supabase.

Create a supabase project and then create a table name streaks with the follwing SQL query.
```
create table streaks (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null default auth.uid(),
  name text,
  word text check (char_length(word) > 0),
  type text,
  onoff text check (char_length(onoff) < 100),
  progress text,
  progressphrase text,
  morse text,
  dot text,
  dash text,
  start timestamp,
  is_active boolean default true
);
alter table streaks enable row level security;
create policy "Individuals can create streaks." on streaks for
    insert with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "Individuals can view their own streaks. " on streaks for
    select using (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "Individuals can update their own streaks." on streaks for
    update using (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "Individuals can delete their own streaks." on streaks for
    delete using (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

Then, in the utility/supabaseClient.ts file, set your supabase URL and key.

You can probably use other backends if you know how to set them up. There is just the one table to create.
