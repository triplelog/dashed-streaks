## About
Trying to keep up a streak is good motivation, but having off days/weeks/months can make it easier. I would rather work a bit harder some days and enjoy the occasional day off, so I decided to create a website that will motivate me to work regularly based off morse code patterns.

Enter a word or phrase and it will be converted into morse code and that pattern determines which days you have complete 0, 1, or 2 tasks. A dot means 1 task, a dash is 2 tasks, and a pause between characters is 0 tasks.

Dashed Streaks tracks your progress as you try to spell out the desired phrase and keeps you informed of the upcoming schedule.

### Description

I used Refine and Ant to interact with a Supabase backend to create a relatively simple productivity app. Refine made it easy to create custom streaks and track your progress.

The project only uses one SQL table so it is simple to setup.


### Participants

I, Robert Wilcox, created Dashed Streaks. My GitHub is https://github.com/triplelog, but I don't have many public repositories. I have bunch of little repls on my Replit profile at https://replit.com/@triplelog.

### Prerequisites

The backend uses supabase.

Create a supabase project and then create a table name streaks with the follwing SQL query.
```
create table streaks (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null default auth.uid(),
  name text,
  word text check (char_length(word) > 0),
  type text,
  onoff text check (char_length(onoff) < 100),
  progress text,
  progressphrase text,
  morse text,
  dot text,
  dash text,
  start timestamp,
  is_active boolean default true
);
alter table streaks enable row level security;
create policy "Individuals can create streaks." on streaks for
    insert with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "Individuals can view their own streaks. " on streaks for
    select using (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "Individuals can update their own streaks." on streaks for
    update using (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "Individuals can delete their own streaks." on streaks for
    delete using (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

Then, in the utility/supabaseClient.ts file, set your supabase URL and key.

You can probably use other backends if you know how to set them up. There is just the one table to create.


### Install Project

- Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/triplelog/dashed-streaks.git
```

- Install and build
```
npm install
npm run build
```

- Serve
```
serve -s build
```

Then visit localhost:3000 in your browser, sign up, and start creating streaks!

You can serve the build folder with a different static server or other port that you wish to setup.
